# ARP_Spoofing_Detection_with_Wireshark
This repository contains the resources and findings from my end-of-course project for the City of London Cybersecurity Bootcamp. The project demonstrates the simulation and detection of ARP spoofing attacks within a controlled virtual lab environment using Kali Linux, Windows 7, and Wireshark.

Project Goals:
- Simulate an ARP spoofing (Man-in-the-Middle) attack in a safe, isolated lab setting.
- Capture and analyze network traffic with Wireshark to investigate ARP table poisoning.
- Identify intrusion indicators, such as duplicate IP/MAC associations and abnormal ARP replies.
- Provide recommendations for detecting and preventing ARP spoofing in real networks.

Key Skills:
Network traffic analysis, Linux security tools, Wireshark forensics, virtualization, cybersecurity reporting.
